          I am an Associate Professor at the Department of <a href="https://politics.korea.ac.kr/kupolitics_kor/index.do" target="_blank">Political Science and International Relations</a> at <a href="https://www.korea.ac.kr/" target="_blank">Korea University</a>.

          My research focuses on the international political economy, with a particular interest in the intersection of domestic politics and international trade. My previous and ongoing work delves into topics such as public attitudes and electoral responses to trade policy as well as China's foreign economic strategies, particularly its trade and foreign aid policies. I am also interested in the political economy of environment and energy, especially public opinion toward environmental politics. My work is forthcoming or has appeared in <em>American Political Science Review</em>, <em>American Journal of Political Science</em>, <em>International Organization</em>, <em>Journal of Politics</em> and <em>British Journal of Political Science</em> among others.
